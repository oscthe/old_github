### Hi there!
<p>
My name is Oscar Thelander and I am a Quantitative Analyst in Stockholm, Sweden.
</p>


<p>
I have a B.Sc. in Economics and two M.Sc. in Finance/Finance and Banking, as I attended a double-degree program at University of Gothenburg and University of Rome Tor Vergata. During my education I focused on quantitative analysis and modelling, an interest I am fortunate to pursue professionally and upon which I continuously try to improve.
</p>

I have broad interests within data science and programming and find most aspects fascinating: algorithms, data quality, EDA, feature engineering, supervised learning, regression analysis, model validation and so on. In my spare time I enjoy tinkering and reading about programming and modelling. I'm currently focusing on deep learning.
### Tools I have worked with
**Languages**: Python, Java, SQL, SAS, Matlab, VBA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Stata.    \\
**Packages**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, SciPy, Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, Matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, statsmodels, BeautifulSoup4, ... \\
**Tools**: Git, Docker, MLflow, MS Office.

### Other
In my spare time I enjoy travelling, reading, and sports. I played a lot of team sports (handball, football) growing up but nowadays enjoy running and powerlifting.
