How many sports have occurred at each summer olympics and how many participating countries?


```python
part_countries = dfs.groupby("Games").NOC.unique()
olympic_years = sorted(dfs.Games.unique())
years = sorted(dfs.Year.unique())
sports_count = dfs.groupby("Games").Sport.unique()
x = [len(x) for x in part_countries]
y = [len(x) for x in sports_count]
z = [x for x in years]
test = pd.DataFrame({"Years": z, "Sports": y, "Countries": x})
```


```python
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
sns.barplot(x="Years", y="Countries", data=test).set_title(
    "Number of Participating Countries"
);
```

What's the medal count look like per country for the Summer Olympics?


```python
bronze_lst = []
silver_lst = []
gold_lst = []
country_lst = []
for country in dfs.NOC.unique():
    bronze_count = dfs[(dfs.NOC == country) & (dfs.Medal == "Bronze")]["ID"].count()
    silver_count = dfs[(dfs.NOC == country) & (dfs.Medal == "Silver")]["ID"].count()
    gold_count = dfs[(dfs.NOC == country) & (dfs.Medal == "Gold")]["ID"].count()
    country_lst.append(country)
    bronze_lst.append(bronze_count)
    silver_lst.append(silver_count)
    gold_lst.append(gold_count)
```


```python
df_medal = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "Country": country_lst,
        "Bronze": bronze_lst,
        "Silver": silver_lst,
        "Gold": gold_lst,
    }
)

df_medal["Tot"] = df_medal["Bronze"] + df_medal["Silver"] + df_medal["Gold"]
```


```python
df_bronze_print = df_medal.sort_values(by=["Bronze"], ascending=False).head(10)
df_silver_print = df_medal.sort_values(by=["Silver"], ascending=False).head(10)
df_gold_print = df_medal.sort_values(by=["Gold"], ascending=False).head(10)
df_tot_print = df_medal.sort_values(by=["Tot"], ascending=False).head(10)
```


```python
fig = go.Figure(
    data=[go.Pie(labels=df_bronze_print["Country"], values=df_bronze_print["Bronze"])]
)
fig.update_traces(
    hoverinfo="label+percent",
    textinfo="value",
    textfont_size=20,
    marker=dict(line=dict(color="#000000", width=2)),

##### Change to medals per event and not per person

The above graphs obviously take into account the number of athletes that receive a medal, that is a team event generates a higher number of medal than an individual event.


```python
df_med = dfs[["NOC", "Games", "Sport", "Event", "Medal"]].drop_duplicates(keep="first")
```


```python
print(dfs.columns)
```

    Index(['ID', 'Name', 'Sex', 'Age', 'Height', 'Weight', 'Team', 'NOC', 'Games',
           'Year', 'Season', 'City', 'Sport', 'Event', 'Medal'],
          dtype='object')



```python
bronze_lst2 = []
silver_lst2 = []
gold_lst2 = []
country_lst2 = []
for country in df_med.NOC.unique():
    bronze_count2 = df_med[(df_med.NOC == country) & (df_med.Medal == "Bronze")][
        "Event"
    ].count()
    silver_count2 = df_med[(df_med.NOC == country) & (df_med.Medal == "Silver")][
        "Event"
    ].count()
    gold_count2 = df_med[(df_med.NOC == country) & (df_med.Medal == "Gold")][
        "Event"
    ].count()
    country_lst2.append(country)
    bronze_lst2.append(bronze_count2)
    silver_lst2.append(silver_count2)
    gold_lst2.append(gold_count2)

df_medal2 = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "Country": country_lst2,
        "Bronze": bronze_lst2,
        "Silver": silver_lst2,
        "Gold": gold_lst2,
    }
)

df_medal2["Tot"] = df_medal2["Bronze"] + df_medal2["Silver"] + df_medal2["Gold"]
df_bronze_print2 = df_medal2.sort_values(by=["Bronze"], ascending=False).head(10)
df_silver_print2 = df_medal2.sort_values(by=["Silver"], ascending=False).head(10)
df_gold_print2 = df_medal2.sort_values(by=["Gold"], ascending=False).head(10)
df_tot_print2 = df_medal2.sort_values(by=["Tot"], ascending=False).head(10)
```


```python

fig.show("png")
```

##### Distribution of medals over age

Lets take a look at the distribution of medals over the age of the participants:


```python
sns.histplot(data=dfs, x="Age", hue="Sex", bins=50).set_title("Age distribution");
```


![png](../images/Olympic_History_files/Olympic_History_32_0.png)


As can be observed, the shape of the distribution are quite similar for women and men - with women not having participated in the Olympics for the same amount of time, thus creating the difference in the number of medals. The women are a little bit more skewed to the younger ages as there are a larger amount of medals in the below 20 year olds for them compared to the men.

##### Looking at which sports favors the oldest and which sports favor the youngest


```python
df_oldest = dfs[dfs["Age"] >= 60]
df_youngest = dfs[dfs["Age"] <= 18]
```


```python
print(df_oldest.Event.value_counts().reset_index(name="Medal").head(10))
```

                                                   index  Medal
    0     Art Competitions Mixed Painting, Unknown Event    172
    1  Art Competitions Mixed Sculpturing, Unknown Event    107
    2         Art Competitions Mixed Painting, Paintings     67
    3        Art Competitions Mixed Sculpturing, Statues     29
    4                 Art Competitions Mixed Sculpturing     23
    5  Art Competitions Mixed Painting, Drawings And ...     22
    6           Equestrianism Mixed Dressage, Individual     16
    7  Art Competitions Mixed Architecture, Architect...     14
    8  Art Competitions Mixed Architecture, Designs F...     13
    9  Art Competitions Mixed Architecture, Unknown E...     11


Historically participants who are 60+ years of age at the time of their olympic games participation have taken the most medals in Art Competitions. I didn't even know that there were such a thing as Art Competitions in the Olympics but a quick google led me to some more information, for further information see:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_competitions_at_the_Summer_Olympics


```python
print(df_youngest.Event.value_counts().reset_index(name="Medal").head(10))
```

                                                 index  Medal
    0         Gymnastics Women's Individual All-Around    843
    1                   Gymnastics Women's Uneven Bars    832
    2                Gymnastics Women's Floor Exercise    827
    3                  Gymnastics Women's Balance Beam    825
    4               Gymnastics Women's Team All-Around    731
    5                   Gymnastics Women's Horse Vault    723
    6  Swimming Women's 4 x 100 metres Freestyle Relay    575
    7     Swimming Women's 4 x 100 metres Medley Relay    490
    8            Swimming Women's 100 metres Freestyle    463
    9           Swimming Women's 100 metres Backstroke    372


For participants who are 18 or younger, the women's gymnastic and swimming events have produced the most medals. If we look at the oldest and youngest in the 2000's:


```python
df_oldest_2000 = dfs[(dfs["Age"] >= 60) & (dfs["Year"] >= 2000)]
df_youngest_2000 = dfs[(dfs["Age"] <= 18) & (dfs["Year"] >= 2000)]
```


```python
print(df_oldest_2000.Event.value_counts().reset_index(name="Medal").head(10))
```

                                                   index  Medal
    0           Equestrianism Mixed Dressage, Individual      5
    1            Equestrianism Mixed Jumping, Individual      4
    2                  Equestrianism Mixed Jumping, Team      4
    3                 Equestrianism Mixed Dressage, Team      3
    4        Shooting Men's Rapid-Fire Pistol, 25 metres      2
    5                           Archery Men's Individual      1
    6                                Shooting Men's Trap      1
    7          Equestrianism Mixed Three-Day Event, Team      1
    8    Equestrianism Mixed Three-Day Event, Individual      1
    9  Shooting Men's Small-Bore Rifle, Prone, 50 metres      1


During the 2000s for participants 60+ we can see that equestrianism and different shooting/archery-events are the events wherein they obtain the most medals.


```python
print(df_youngest_2000.Event.value_counts().reset_index(name="Medal").head(10))
```

                                                 index  Medal
    0         Gymnastics Women's Individual All-Around    250
    1                   Gymnastics Women's Uneven Bars    243
    2                Gymnastics Women's Floor Exercise    242
    3                  Gymnastics Women's Balance Beam    240
    4               Gymnastics Women's Team All-Around    211
    5                Rhythmic Gymnastics Women's Group    169
    6                   Gymnastics Women's Horse Vault    136
    7             Swimming Women's 50 metres Freestyle    128
    8  Swimming Women's 4 x 200 metres Freestyle Relay     87
    9     Swimming Women's 4 x 100 metres Medley Relay     77


For the 2000s, the participants who are 18 or below is roughly the same sports as it has been historically, i.e. gymnastics, rhytmic gymnastics as well as swimming. As can be observed here again - women are dominant in receiving medals when 18 or younger as no men's event is in the top 10 in this list.

##### Women medals per olympic games

We observed in the above histogram that women have received fewer medals in total than men. So now let's take a look at the historical development for women.


```python
df_w = dfs[dfs.Sex == "F"]
w_n_events = [len(x) for x in df_w.groupby("Year").Event.unique()]
w_n_parts = [x for x in df_w.groupby("Year").apply(lambda x: len(x["Name"].unique()))]
w_y_events = [int(x) for x in sorted(df_w.Year.unique())]
df_w_pa = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "Year": w_y_events,
        "Number of events": w_n_events,
        "Number of participants": w_n_parts,
    }
)
```


```python
print(df_w_pa.head())
```

       Year  Number of events  Number of participants
    0  1900                 8                      23
    1  1904                 3                       6
    2  1906                 2                       6
    3  1908                 7                      44
    4  1912                 7                      53


So women first participated at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. Let's look at the number of events held for the women over time:


```python
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
sns.barplot(x="Year", y="Number of events", data=df_w_pa).set_title("Number of Events");
```


![png](../images/Olympic_History_files/Olympic_History_50_0.png)



```python

Putting these numbers into percentages as of all events and participants during these years:


```python
df_m = dfs[(dfs.Sex == "M") & (dfs.Year >= w_y_events[0])]
m_n_events = [len(x) for x in df_m.groupby("Year").Event.unique()]
m_n_parts = [x for x in df_m.groupby("Year").apply(lambda x: len(x["Name"].unique()))]
m_y_events = [int(x) for x in sorted(df_m.Year.unique())]
df_pa_tot = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "Year": m_y_events,
        "Nm_events": m_n_events,
        "Nm_part": m_n_parts,
        "Nw_events": w_n_events,
        "Nw_part": w_n_parts,
    }
)

df_pa_tot["Tot_part"] = df_pa_tot["Nm_part"] + df_pa_tot["Nw_part"]
df_pa_tot["Tot_events"] = df_pa_tot["Nm_events"] + df_pa_tot["Nw_events"]
df_pa_tot["Prc_w_part"] = 100 * df_pa_tot["Nw_part"] / df_pa_tot["Tot_part"]
df_pa_tot["Prc_w_events"] = 100 * df_pa_tot["Nw_events"] / df_pa_tot["Tot_events"]
df_pa_tot["Prc_m_part"] = 100 * df_pa_tot["Nm_part"] / df_pa_tot["Tot_part"]
df_pa_tot["Prc_m_events"] = 100 * df_pa_tot["Nm_events"] / df_pa_tot["Tot_events"]
```


```python
print(df_pa_tot.tail())
```

As can be observed, the women represented a fraction of participants in the beginning of the 1900s but have gradually taking a larger and larger part. The black line, showing 50%, is where the men and women are trending as the percentages of both events and participants are getting closer and closer.

##### Sweden distribution medals over events, number of participants and events

The following list shows top 10 number of medals per event descending:


```python
df_SWE_n = dfs.loc[dfs["NOC"] == "SWE"]
df_SWE = df_med.loc[df_med["NOC"] == "SWE"]
print(df_SWE.Event.value_counts().reset_index(name="Medal").head(10))
```

                                                index  Medal
    0              Modern Pentathlon Men's Individual     40
    1             Cycling Men's Road Race, Individual     29
    2             Swimming Men's 100 metres Freestyle     27
    3                       Athletics Men's High Jump     26
    4                  Fencing Men's epee, Individual     25
    5       Wrestling Men's Middleweight, Greco-Roman     25
    6  Wrestling Men's Light-Heavyweight, Greco-Roman     24
    7                      Athletics Men's Pole Vault     23
    8                   Athletics Men's Javelin Throw     23
    9           Swimming Women's 100 metres Freestyle     22



```python
olympic_years = sorted(df_SWE_n.Games.unique())
years = sorted(df_SWE_n.Year.unique())
sports_count = df_SWE_n.groupby("Games").Sport.unique()
swe_parts = df_SWE_n.groupby("Games")["NOC"].count()
y = [len(x) for x in sports_count]
z = [x for x in years]
w = [x for x in swe_parts]
test = pd.DataFrame({"Years": z, "Sports": y, "Swedish Participants": w})
```


```python
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
sns.barplot(x="Years", y="Swedish Participants", data=test).set_title(
    "Number of Swedish Participants throughout history"
)
plt.savefig("SwedishParticipants.png")
```

1912, the year in which the spike can be observed in the above barplot, the Summer Olympics was hosted in Stockholm, Sweden.

##### Age distribution of Swedish medalists and Swedish participants in total


```python
dfs_SWE_med = dfs[(dfs["NOC"] == "SWE") & (dfs["Medal"].notna())]
```


```python
swe_tot = [x for x in df_SWE_n["Age"]]
swe_medals = [x for x in dfs_SWE_med["Age"]]
```

As can be observed in the plot below, the age distribution for the medalists follows closely that of the participants.


```python
plt.hist([swe_tot, swe_medals], bins=30)
plt.title(
    "Age distribution of Swedish participants and Swedish medalists at the Olympics"
)
plt.legend(["Participants", "Medalists"]);
```
