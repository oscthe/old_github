<h3 id="hi-there">Hi there!</h3>
<p>
My name is Oscar Thelander and I am a Quantitative Analyst in Stockholm, Sweden.
</p>

<p>
I have a B.Sc. in Economics and two M.Sc. in Finance/Finance and Banking, as I attended a double-degree program at University of Gothenburg and University of Rome Tor Vergata. During my education I focused on quantitative analysis and modelling, an interest I am fortunate to pursue professionally and upon which I continuously try to improve.
</p>

<p>I have broad interests within data science and programming and find many aspects fascinating: algorithms, data quality, EDA, feature engineering, supervised learning, regression analysis, model validation and so on. In my spare time I enjoy tinkering and reading about programming and modelling. I’m currently focusing on deep learning.</p>
