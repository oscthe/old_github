I"ê<p>In my master‚Äôs thesis I tested the effect of different calibration techniques on option pricing models. More specifically, I looked at whether the choice of objective function had an effect on the performance and empirical specification of a model developed by prof. David Bates. In this post, I challenge my thesis using the latest neural network specifications reported in the literature.</p>
