      <div class="entry">
        <p>In the process of data wrangling, dealing with missing values is an inevitable step. There are many techniques for solving this problem, popular choices being: mean, median, most frequent, kNN, and regression. Herein I evaluate these 5 methods over X different datasets, focusing on Mediocristan vs Extremistan.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>In my master’s thesis I tested the effect of different calibration techniques on option pricing models. More specifically, I looked at whether the choice of objective function had an effect on the performance and empirical specification of a model developed by prof. David Bates. In this post, I challenge my thesis using the latest neural network specifications reported in the literature.</p>
