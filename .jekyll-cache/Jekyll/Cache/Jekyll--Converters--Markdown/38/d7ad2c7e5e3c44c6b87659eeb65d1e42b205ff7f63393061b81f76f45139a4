My name is Oscar Thelander and I am a Quantitative Analyst in Stockholm, Sweden.
</p>

<p>
I have a B.Sc. in Economics and two M.Sc. in Finance/Finance and Banking, as I attended a double-degree program at University of Gothenburg and University of Rome Tor Vergata. During my education I focused on quantitative analysis and modelling, an interest I am fortunate to pursue professionally and upon which I continuously try to improve.
</p>

<p>I have a broad interest within the data analysis-domain and find most aspects fascinating: data quality, EDA, feature engineering, supervised learning, regression analysis, model validation and so on. In my spare time I enjoy tinkering and reading about programming and modelling where I’m currently focused on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deep Learning applied to finance and economics (pricing, asset allocation, etc.)</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
